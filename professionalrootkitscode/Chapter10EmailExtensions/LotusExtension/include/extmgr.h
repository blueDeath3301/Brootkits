				CONFLICT_ACTION_HANDLE	- User handled the conflict	
				(zero)					- Proceed with Conflict in normal manner


	EM_ADMINPPROCESSREQUEST occurs prior to and after the Administration Process has
	processed a request on a server.

	STATUS LNPUBLIC ProcessRequest (
						NOTEHANDLE nhRequest, The handle of the Admin Request note 
						NOTEHANDLE nhResponse); The handle of the Admin Log note  


	EM_TERMINATENSF occurs when NSF service terminates for the process.

	void LNPUBLIC TerminateNSF (void *unused_params);


	EM_NSFNOTEUPDATEMAILBOX occurs when a NSFNoteUpdate is performed on 
	any and all mailbox databases (e.g. mail.box).  This is true even if
	multiple mailboxes are enabled in the server configuration document.
	The arguments are identical to those used for EM_NSFNOTEUPDATE.
	

	EM_NIFOPENNOTE opens a note by index position and optionally navigates.
	It is used by the Notes Editor.

	STATUS LNPUBLIC NIFOpenNote (
						HCOLLECTION hCollection,
						COLLECTIONPOSITION far *IndexPos,
						WORD Navigator,
						WORD FallbackNavigator,
						NOTEID NoteID,
						DWORD OpenFlags,
						INDEXSPECIALINFO far *retIndexInfo,
						HANDLE far *rethNote);


	EM_NSFNOTEOPENEXTENDED is a Notes internal, extended form of NSFNoteOpen.

	STATUS LNPUBLIC NSFNoteOpenExtended (
						DBHANDLE hDB,
						NOTEID NoteID,
						DWORD flags, 
						DWORD SinceSeqNum,
						BYTE *pKey,
						HANDLE *rtn);


	EM_MAILSENDNOTE is called when the Mailer sends an open note to recipients
	listed in the note's header items.

	STATUS LNPUBLIC MailSendNote (
						HANDLE			hNote,
						void			*internalViewDesc, 
						WORD			Flags, 
						BOOL			*Modified,
						void			*SendNoteCtx);


	EM_NSFMARKREAD is called when a note is opened by the Notes client and marked READ.
	Note that this does not include other mechanisms that could result in a note being
	marked read, such as being read by the client on another replica.

	STATUS LNPUBLIC NSFMarkRead(
							DBHANDLE	hDB,			- Handle of database containing note being marked
							HANDLE		hNote,			- Handle to note being marked read
							NOTEID		NoteID);		- NoteID of the note being marked read


	EM_NSFADDTOFOLDER is called when a note is being added or removed 
	from a folder.  The IsAddOperation flag should be checked to determine
	if this note is being added or removed from the folder.

	STATUS LNPUBLIC NSFAddToFolder( 
							DBHANDLE	hViewDB,		- Handle of database containing folder
							DBHANDLE	hDataDB,		- Handle of database containing notes being added to folder
							NOTEID		FolderNoteID,	- NoteID of the folder note
							NOTEID		NoteID,			- NoteID of the note being added to (removed from) the folder
							UNID		*NoteUNID,		- UNID of the note being added to (removed from) the folder
							BOOL		IsAddOperation,	- TRUE if note being added to the folder, FALSE if note being removed
							TIMEDATE	*RevisionTime);	- Time of original folder addition (OPTIONAL - may be NULL)

	EM_SMTPCONNECT is called when an inbound SMTP connection has been detected.
	
	The Extension Manager EM_BEFORE notification type for the EM_SMTPCONNECT event occurs when an 
	inbound SMTP connection has been detected and prior to the execution of the internal Domino SMTP 
	restriction controls.  Callback routine can implement their own anti-relay checks and bypass 
	Domino related checks through the use of PossibleRelay BOOL and return status of value NOERROR.  
	Return STATUS other than ERR_EM_CONTINUE or NOERROR sets AccessDenied flag which causes subsequent 
	commands to be rejected.  

	The Extension Manager EM_AFTER notification type for the EM_SMTPCONNECT event occurs after the SMTP 
	listener task has accepted the connection but prior to sending the SMTP greeting to the connecting host.

	STATUS LNPUBLIC SMTPConnect(
							DWORD	SessionID,			- Unique session identifier
							char	*RemoteIP,			- NULL terminated string containing IP address of connecting host
							char	*RemoteHost,		- NULL terminated string containing host name of connecting host if reverse DNS 
														lookup was successful.  If lookup was unsuccessful, the string length will be zero.
							BOOL	&PossibleRelay, 	- Indicator whether connecting host should be treated as possible relay or not
							char	*Greeting,			- Greeting that will be returned to the connecting host
														- Greeting is NULL during EM_BEFORE notification
							DWORD	MaxGreetingLength);	- Size of buffer allocated to modify Greeting

	EM_SMTPCOMMAND is called whenever a SMTP command has been received by the SMTP task.
	
	The Extension Manager EM_BEFORE notification type for the EM_SMTPCOMMAND event occurs whenever a SMTP 
	command has been received by the SMTP listener task but prior to the parsing of the command. 
	
	Domino allocates a buffer that can be used by callback routines for the EM_BEFORE notification to modify 
	the command and thus change internal Domino processing.  NOERROR return status indicates to skip parsing 
	and execution of command.  The default reply when STATUS is NOERROR is "250 OK".  Return STATUS values 
	other than ERR_EM_CONTINUE and NOERROR from the EM_BEFORE notification results in the command being 
	rejected.  A default error message will be generated by the Domino SMTP server, which can be modified by 
	the callback routine for the EM_AFTER notification.  STATUS of ERR_EM_CONTINUE will continue normal Domino 
	processing.
	
	SMTP response to the command entered can be modified during the callback routine of EM_AFTER notification.  
	Care must be taken not to change the reply code from success to failure or vice-versa as this will cause 
	the sender-SMTP and receiver-SMTP servers to be out of synch.  Domino supplies a buffer that can 
	be used by the callback routine to change the SMTP response.

	STATUS LNPUBLIC SMTPCommand(
							DWORD	SessionID,			- Unique session identifier
							char	*Command,			- NULL terminated string containing SMTP command and arguments received
							DWORD	MaxCommandLength,	- Size of buffer allocated to modify Command
							char	*SMTPReply,			- SMTP response that will be returned to the connecting host
														- SMTPReply is NULL during EM_BEFORE notification
							DWORD 	SMTPReplyLength);	- Size of buffer allocated to modify SMTPReply

	EM_SMTPMESSAGEACCEPT is called following the receipt of "end of mail data indicator", a line containing a single
	period, and itemization of the MIME stream into an in-memory note.

	Following the receipt of the "end of mail data indicator", the resulting stream is itemized to an 
	in-memory note.  The Extension Manager EM_BEFORE notification type for the EM_SMTPMESSAGEACCEPT event 
	occurs following itemization but prior to adding the note to the mailbox.  If the callback routine 
	returns STATUS of NOERROR, the Domino SMTP server will stop further processing of the message.  By default
	a success response is generated by core Domino code when NOERROR STATUS has been returned. It is also 
	possible for the callback routine to intercept the message and deposit to database where scans can be 
	performed.  The Callback routine can make changes to the note in the EM_BEFORE event but should not 
	attempt to close the note as this is done by the core code.  

	The Extension Manager EM_AFTER notification type for the EM_SMTPMESSAGEACCEPT event occurs after the SMTP 
	listener task attempted to submit the message to the mailbox but prior to sending a reply.  The Callback 
	routines for the EM_AFTER notification can change the reply returned to the connecting host however, care 
	must be taken not to change the reply code from success to error or vice-versa as this would cause the 
	sender-SMTP and receiver-SMTP servers to be out of synch.

	STATUS LNPUBLIC SMTPMessageAccept(
							DWORD	SessionID,			- Unique session identifier
							NOTEHANDLE	Note,			- Note containing the itemized message
							char	*SMTPReply,			- SMTP Response that will be returned to the connecting host
														- SMTPReply is NULL during EM_BEFORE notification
							DWORD	SMTPReplyLength);	- Size of buffer allocated to modify SMTPReply

	EM_SMTPDISCONNECT is called when a SMTP connection is being torn down.  This includes normal and abnormal disconnects,
	such as when the QUIT command is issued or when a session times out.

	STATUS LNPUBLIC SMTPDisconnect(
							DWORD	SessionID);			- Unique session identifier


	The following 2 archive calls are NOT defined

	EM_NSFARCHIVEDELETENOTES is called after documents have been selected and copied to
	the destination db if desired. It is time for archiving to delete the archived notes
	that qualify from the source database 

   	STATUS LNPUBLIC NSFArchiveDeleteNotes( 
			DBHANDLE 	hDB, 			- handle of the source db where notes will be deleted from
			HANDLE 		hTempIDTable, 	- handle of the id table containing the notes ids to be deleted
			DWORD 		dwFlags ); 		- none at this time
			

	EM_NSFARCHIVECOPYNOTES is called after documents have been selected  for archiving and
	copies them from the source db to the specified destination db  

 	STATUS LNPUBLIC NSFArchiveCopyNotes(
 		DBHANDLE hSrcDB,  		  - dbhandle of the source db
 		DBHANDLE hDestDB, 		  - dbhandle of the destination db
 		HANDLE   hIdTable, 		  - handle to the id table containing the note ids to be copied to the dest
 		DWORD    dwFlags, 		  - none at this time
 		TIMEDATE *ptdSrcMod, 	  - pointer to a timedate for last modified time of source db
 		REPLFILESTATS *pStats);   - pointer to a REPLFILESTATS strcuture containing the stats of the copy


	The following functions ARE defined, but their extension manager callouts
	have slightly different signatures than the standard mechanism because of
	the fact that the function returns something other than STATUS.  The
	extension manager callout has an added argument which allows the callout
	to write the return value of the API routine.  For purposes of the callout,
	it is as if the function signatures were as follows.

	STATUS LNPUBLIC AgentIsEnabled(HAGENT hAgent, BOOL *return_value);
  
	EM_SECAUTHENTICATION is called on the server after the Notes Authentication
	succeeds but before the session is opened. 

	STATUS LNPUBLIC Authentication  (WORD		wEvent
									,SESSIONID	SessionId
									,char		far * pRemoteName
									,DWORD		dwFlags
									,WORD		wNetProtocol
									,char		far * NetAddress
									,void 		far * vpNull
									)



	This function is called every time a note is encountered during database media recovery.  The database being recovered can
		not be changed in any way but the note can be, for example, copied off to a different database.  This can be used, for example,
		for salavaging the content of notes which are going to be deleted at a later point in the media recovery process.

	STATUS LNPUBLIC NSFDbMediaRecoveryNote(DBHANDLE hDB, HANDLE hNote, BOOL IsInsert, BOOL IsUpdate, BOOL IsDelete)
